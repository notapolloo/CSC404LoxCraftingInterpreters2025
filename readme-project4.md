I decided to implement 3 native functions 
Echo Exit and Type
To do this, I used the already made "Clock" as a reference point 
and made the global define a function "type" and "echo"
Type would take the first part the of arguments (parameters in the function) and simply return its java class as a string.
Echo would simply print what ever it is given and then return it. 
Exit was trickier to figure out but then I found out java has a built in exit and just used that.
